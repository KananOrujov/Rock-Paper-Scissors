🧪 Approach 5: Synthetic Time Series Generation with Differential Privacy
📋 Project Description
This project investigates privacy-preserving synthetic time series generation using two deep learning models enhanced with Differential Privacy (DP): DP-GAN and DP-TimeGAN. The goal is to generate synthetic sequences that maintain the statistical properties of the original data while offering formal privacy guarantees.

This work was contributed by Kanan Orujov, focusing on integrating DP techniques into generative models for sequence data.
